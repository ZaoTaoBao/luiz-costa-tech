Most common cache eviction policies:
## First In First Out (FIFO): 
The cache evicts the first block accessed first without any regard to how often or how many times it was accessed before.

## Last In First Out (LIFO): 
The cache evicts the block accessed most recently first without any regard to how often or how many times it was accessed before.

## Least Recently Used (LRU): 
Discards the least recently used items first.

## Most Recently Used (MRU): 
Discards, in contrast to LRU, the most recently used items first.

## Least Frequently Used (LFU): 
Counts how often an item is needed. Those that are used least often are discarded first.

## Random Replacement (RR): 
Randomly selects a candidate item and discards it to make space when necessary.
